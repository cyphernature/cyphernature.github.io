        <h6>From me to you</h6>
        <p>Cypher Nature is meant to be a name representing the nature of the world as we figure it out. Its a cypher, a puzzle. As we at Cypher Nature build our skills we will share the 'how to' with you.
          <br><br>
          Ben Hawklyn is a Cal State East Bay Student who is a dual Communications and Multimedia major. He has helped organize the CSUEB Game Jam events through the Multimedia Group. Through the Multimedia Group he hosts workshops ranging from 3D Modeling to Communication and Presentation. One of his dreams is to create small indie film or games with authentic representation.
          <!--I am Santa Cruz born, Watsonville raised, and Bay Area arrived where I found counciousness. I have worked with students afterschool to teach new and interesting aspects of art and technology such as 3D modeling and animation -- as it was not in the curriciulum of the unversity and I felt it was neccessary. As I near my bachelors completion I find a bit of a sweet and sour taste in my mouth as the university is putting forth a BFA in 3D modeling and graphic design. I would like to think that I spearfronted the neccessity and built up the demand however this complicates my life. I had a fantasy in the back of my mind to be quite honest -- that when I completed my masters I could teach 3D modeling and animation (as it was not available). I had spent enough time thinking of curiculum for workshops that I would have welcomed the chance to build something more supstantial.

        For now, I will do what I can in my life to help people where I can while also taking care of myself. -- Audre Lorde -- Self care is survival.
